# Fold-em

Game for poker players using Texas Hold'em rules. Guessing the number of wins basing on cards that you see. Each round as the game goes you see more cards - only your hand (hand), hand and three cards on the table (flop), hand and four cards (turn) and at the end all seven cards (river). The game ends with the summary of your predictions.
